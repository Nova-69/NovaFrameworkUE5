# NovaFrameworkUE5
Sonic framework made in Unreal Engine 5, by yours truly. Due to me not really having the time nor motivation to work on this project much, it's just been sitting on my
desktop for a while, and given to close friends that could put it to use. Seeing that they have actually been able to do some cool things with this framework, I thought
I might as well release it to the public. Hopefully it is of some use to you all! I might work on this on some later point but I wouldn't really count on it.

<h1>Preview/Features</h1>
Here's a fairly outdated and poorly recorded video for your enjoyment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMjJtYZnIzY
<br>
<br>
Main features are momentum-based physics, good sense of speed due to dynamic FOV, your standard Sonic moveset (dropdash, boost, spindash, loop functionality, and partially finished rails), as well as rings that magnetize towards you when boosting and a fairly dumb spring. No enemies or homing attack unfortunatly. On the graphical
side of things, this framework features a proper Master material setup for just about anything you'd plan to make in a Sonic fangame, high fidelity materials for Sonic
(including the moving eye-shine dot, courtesy of Dynu) and a good setup to get you started for any other character you'd like to add. Lost World style particles and animations are also used for the footsteps, jumpball, running particle, and main Sonic pawn. These particles and animations combined with the dynamic FOV allow you to get a pretty unique and good-feeling play style. Also, press ALT for freecam mode

<h1>Setup</h1>
It's pretty simple, but does require a few more steps than just downloading from the <b>releases tab</b>. This was made before UE5 was fully released, but it should still 
function perfectly fine on newer versions. Due to Ninja Character Movement not having a UE5 release at the time, I recompiled it myself, and it works (despite a lil 
error message on startup, just ignore that kthx). You can grab that here - https://mega.nz/file/5D4AWIxJ#o2Yzf3Fk5RnH1q1CQZEpc6n_HsaYzuEFPRDfkEoDTC8.

After that's downloaded, place it here -

Alternatively, they have released an update for UE5 on the marketplace since I started this project. I've never tested it but it should probably work, you can try it if you'd like. For now I'll still leave my own recompile in this README incase there are any issues I'm unaware of.

Anyways, now you should be fully setup to start developing with this framework!
