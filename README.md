# NovaFrameworkUE5
Sonic framework made in Unreal Engine 5, by yours truly. Due to me not really having the time nor motivation to work on this project much, it's just been sitting on my
desktop for a while, and given to close friends that could put it to use. Seeing that they have actually been able to do some cool things with this framework, I thought
I might as well release it to the public. Hopefully it is of some use to you all! I might work on this on some later point but I wouldn't really count on it.

<h1>Setup</h1>
It's pretty simple, but does require a few more steps than just downloading from the <b>releases tab</b>. This was made before UE5 was fully released, but it should still 
function perfectly fine on newer versions. Due to Ninja Character Movement not having a UE5 release at the time, I recompiled it myself, and it works (despite a lil 
error message on startup, just ignore that kthx). You can grab that here - https://mega.nz/file/5D4AWIxJ#o2Yzf3Fk5RnH1q1CQZEpc6n_HsaYzuEFPRDfkEoDTC8

After that's downloaded, place it here -

And now you should be fully setup to use the project!
